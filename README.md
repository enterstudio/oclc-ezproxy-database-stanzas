# oclc-ezproxy-database-stanzas

This repository contains EZProxy Database Stanzas provided by OCLC at [https://www.oclc.org/support/services/ezproxy/documentation/db.en.html](https://www.oclc.org/support/services/ezproxy/documentation/db.en.html).

Each stanza has its own directory in [stanzas](https://github.com/kent-state-university-libraries/oclc-ezproxy-database-stanzas/tree/master/stanzas). The actual configuration can be found in a text file within the stanza's directory called "stanza.txt".

If there are extra instructions provided by OCLC for the stanza, they can be found in a README.md file
