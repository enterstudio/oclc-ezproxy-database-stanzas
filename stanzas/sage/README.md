## Some of OCLC's notes for this stanza

December 2016: Sage is in the process of migrating to a new platform. The new siteâ€™s URL patterns are much simpler, and ultimately will eliminate the need for the lengthy sage.txt IncludeFile.

At your earliest convenience, please add the new stanza below the current one (either the IncludeFile line or your local Sage stanza):

HTTPHeader X-Requested-With
 Title Sage Journals
 URL http://journals.sagepub.com

 Replace url = "http://^A
 Find "google-analytics.com
 Replace "^pgoogle-analytics.com^
 Find url = document.location.protocol + "//" + document.location.host
 Replace url = "http://journals.sagepub.com/"

Sage has requested that libraries not begin updating their Starting Point URLs until Tuesday December 6. Permanent redirects will be in place from the old URLs (e.g. aaf.sagepub.com) to the new platform to assure continued access during the transition period.
